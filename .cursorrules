# Workflow

When instructed "local work":
1. Get a summary of current changes using `mcp__change_summary`
2. Commit and push using `mcp__commit_and_push` with a short conventional commit message

When instructed "next issue":
1. List and select first unblocked issue using `mcp__list_issues`
2. Start work using `mcp__start_issue` with the selected issue number
3. Work on the issue, keep changes focused to only the issue at hand:
   - Implement changes
   - Run tests locally
   - Update documentation
4. Get a summary of changes using `mcp__change_summary`
5. Commit and push using `mcp__commit_and_push` with a short conventional commit message
6. Complete issue using `mcp__complete_issue`

Error Handling:
- Debug and fix issues as they arise
- If stuck:
  1. Note blocking issue and solutions tried
  2. Reset to last successful commit
  3. Try new approach
  4. When stuck for too long, stop
